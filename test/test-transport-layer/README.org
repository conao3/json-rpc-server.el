* Transport Layer Test Package

In order to test the transport layer, HTTP requests have to be made for *outside
Emacs.* To do this, I use python scripts. To manage the Python-based tests, I
leverage the testing facilities of Nose.

** Running the Tests

An Elisp wrapper is provided to spin up a test server and run the Python
tests against it automatically.

To run the test suite, load the file "test-json-rpc-ews-transport-layer.el" and
call the function `jrpc-run-transport-layer-tests'. This function can be called
interactively. It will spin up the test server and run the Python tests against
it.

Note that these tests do not run in a virtualized Emacs like Cask tests do. They
will modify your JSON-RPC server settings. It is recommended that you reload
your user configuration after running them if you wish to use the JSON-RPC
server.
